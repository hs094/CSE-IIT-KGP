This research has successfully developed an agentic system for generating high-quality synthetic conversations to support the fine-tuning of language models for tobacco cessation. Building upon our previous work in mobile application development, backend infrastructure, and retrieval-augmented generation, we have addressed a critical challenge in healthcare AI: the scarcity of domain-specific training data that maintains both clinical accuracy and patient privacy.

The \textbf{doc2conv} library represents the core contribution of this work—an agent-based system that leverages multiple specialized AI agents to generate realistic, clinically accurate conversations between healthcare providers and individuals seeking tobacco cessation support. This system demonstrates several significant advantages over traditional approaches to training data creation:

\begin{itemize}[label=$\bullet$, leftmargin=1cm, itemsep=0.2cm]
\item \textbf{Efficiency}: Generating synthetic conversations at a rate 24 times faster than manual creation
\item \textbf{Clinical Accuracy}: Producing content that adheres to evidence-based tobacco cessation guidelines
\item \textbf{Conversational Diversity}: Creating varied scenarios that reflect the complexity of tobacco addiction
\item \textbf{Reasoning Transparency}: Incorporating chain-of-thought processes that enhance explainability
\end{itemize}

Our evaluation demonstrates that models fine-tuned on doc2conv-generated conversations show substantial improvements across key metrics, including a 35.9\% increase in reasoning transparency, 20.0\% improvement in ROUGE-L scores, 33.8\% enhancement in explanation clarity, and 20.5\% growth in user trust ratings. These improvements are particularly significant in the healthcare domain, where transparency and trustworthiness are essential for effective interventions.

The integration of this agentic conversation generation system with our previously developed components—a Flutter-based mobile interface, Spring Boot backend infrastructure, and retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms—creates a comprehensive framework for AI-driven tobacco cessation support. This framework addresses the full spectrum of requirements for effective digital health interventions: accessibility, personalization, evidence-based content, and user engagement.

As healthcare AI continues to evolve, the methodologies developed in this research have broader implications beyond tobacco cessation. The agentic approach to synthetic data generation could be adapted to other specialized healthcare domains facing similar data scarcity challenges. Furthermore, the emphasis on transparency through chain-of-thought reasoning contributes to the development of more trustworthy AI systems in healthcare generally.

In conclusion, this research demonstrates that agentic systems can effectively generate the high-quality, domain-specific conversations needed to fine-tune language models for specialized healthcare applications.
