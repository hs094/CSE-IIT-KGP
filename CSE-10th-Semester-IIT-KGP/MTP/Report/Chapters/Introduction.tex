\section{Overview}
\begin{quotation}
\noindent Tobacco use remains one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide, with over 8 million deaths annually attributed to direct tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure. Despite decades of public health initiatives, the challenge of effective tobacco cessation persists, with success rates for unassisted quit attempts hovering below 10\%. The emergence of \textbf{artificial intelligence (AI)} and \textbf{natural language processing (NLP)} technologies presents unprecedented opportunities to address this challenge through personalized, accessible, and scalable interventions.
\end{quotation}

Recent advances in \textbf{large language models (LLMs)} have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding context, generating human-like text, and engaging in meaningful dialogue. These capabilities make LLMs particularly well-suited for health interventions that require nuanced, personalized communication. However, the effectiveness of these models in specialized domains like tobacco cessation depends heavily on their training dataâ€”specifically, their exposure to relevant, high-quality conversations that reflect the complexities of addiction recovery.

\textbf{Data Scarcity Challenge}\\[0.2cm]
A significant barrier to developing effective AI-driven tobacco cessation tools is the scarcity of domain-specific training data. Conversations between healthcare providers and individuals seeking to quit tobacco are rarely documented in formats suitable for model training. Moreover, these conversations contain sensitive personal health information that cannot be freely shared for AI development.}}

This data scarcity creates a bottleneck in the development pipeline for specialized healthcare AI applications, limiting the potential impact of technological innovations in addressing one of the world's most significant public health challenges.

\section{Problem Statement}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5!white,colframe=gray!75!black,title=Research Problem]
The development of effective AI systems for tobacco cessation faces a critical challenge: the lack of diverse, high-quality conversational data needed to train and fine-tune language models for this specialized healthcare domain. Existing approaches to generating synthetic training data often produce conversations that lack the nuance, clinical accuracy, and conversational depth required for effective tobacco cessation support. This limitation hampers the development of AI systems that can provide personalized, contextually appropriate guidance to individuals attempting to quit tobacco use.
\end{tcolorbox}

This research addresses this fundamental challenge by investigating:

\begin{quote}
\textit{How can we develop an \textbf{agentic system} that generates realistic, clinically accurate conversations between healthcare providers and individuals seeking tobacco cessation support, suitable for fine-tuning open-source language models for tobacco cessation applications?}
\end{quote}

\section{Research Questions}
This research explores the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{RQ\arabic*.}, leftmargin=1.5cm, itemsep=0.3cm]
\item \textit{How can multi-agent systems be designed to simulate realistic conversations between healthcare providers and individuals seeking tobacco cessation support?}

\item \textit{What conversational structures and clinical protocols best represent effective tobacco cessation counseling for training data generation?}

\item \textit{How can we ensure clinical accuracy and adherence to evidence-based tobacco cessation guidelines in synthetically generated conversations?}

\item \textit{What role does persona diversity (both provider and patient) play in generating training data that supports robust model generalization?}

\item \textit{How does the quality of synthetically generated conversations compare to real-world tobacco cessation counseling sessions?}

\item \textit{What impact does training on synthetically generated conversations have on the performance of open-source language models for tobacco cessation applications?}

\item \textit{How can chain-of-thought reasoning improve the transparency and clinical reasoning capabilities of language models fine-tuned for tobacco cessation?}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Objective of the Thesis}
