      \textbf{Assistant} \textit{Arre, 15 saal ki baat hai! I'm glad your doctor advised you to quit. That takes a lot of courage. Smoking like a pack a day is a big habit to break. How does it make you feel when you think about quitting?}

      \textbf{User:} \textit{i never thought about the money aspect. thats actually alot when you add it up. so what do you think is the first step for someone like me?}
      
      \vspace{0.2cm}
      \textbf{Assistant} \textit{The money can be a big burden, isn't it? Let's take a look at how much you're spending on cigarettes each month. If we assume an average pack costs ₹500, that's a lot! If you quit for just one day, you could save ₹500. What would you do with that extra money?}

      \vspace{0.2cm}
      \textbf{Assistant} \textit{That's wonderful! Having your wife's support will definitely help you stay on track. Now, let's make a plan for tomorrow. I'll give you a simple phrase to repeat to yourself: "Main nikalunga" (I will quit).}
