# Assignmnet 2 
## Part 1:- Image Classification
You have a notebook / ipynb file named `assingment-2-image-classification.ipynb`, open the file in a ipynb environment. You can use `Kaggle`(Preferable), `Colab` or `Jupyter`, (Try to use one with `GPU` for Less Training Time), as CIFAR10 is imported from torch, We can just run the file and get the outputs, The outputs and plots are shown, details can be sought from the Logs.
## Part 2:- Image Segmentation
You have a notebook / ipynb file named `assingment-2-image-segmentation.ipynb`, open the file in a ipynb environment. You can use `Kaggle`(Preferable), `Colab` or `Jupyter`, (Try to use one with `GPU` for Less Training Time), the Link to download the dataset is mentioned in the notebook (`Dataset`:  https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/cityscapes-image-pairs). Download the dataset and place in the same level as the notebook, or upload in the online environments. Run the Notebook, the outputs and plots will be displayed, next check the Logs for more detailed step by step outputs.

### Further Information
The compiled and executed notebooks are included in the submission, you can check for further information. 
Next, 
1. Output `plots` for `Classification` and `Segmentation` are present in the respective folders under the `Output` folder.
2. Logs for the execution are contained in the `Log` folder.
3. Report for the Assignment is named `Report.pdf`.
